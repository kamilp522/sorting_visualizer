# Sorting Visualizer

Idea for this project came from [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://www.youtube.com/@clem/videos) tough i didn't watch his [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc).

I've just seen it in the recommended videos section and I thought "hey, that's a great project to practice frontend skills and algorithms at the same time!"

Watching any tutorial for longer than 3 minutes makes me wanna end myself, so I'll build it from scratch.

I'll update this readme along with the project.
