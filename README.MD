# Sorting Visualizer

Idea for this project came from [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://www.youtube.com/@clem/videos) tough i didn't watch his [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXYym4Wbkc).

I've just seen it in the recommended videos section and I thought "hey, that's a great project to practice frontend skills and algorithms at the same time!"

Watching any tutorial for longer than 3 minutes makes me wanna end myself, so I'll build it from scratch.

I'll update this readme along with the project.

### update 29.12.2022

The current version of the program doesn't measure the actual algorithm performance. It shows how the shown method works but speed is controlled by the user.

The performance measurements will be implemented in the future
